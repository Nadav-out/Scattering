# 2-to-2 scattering for Self-Interacting-Dark-Matter
Here we present one module of a larger package (under construction), aimed at calculating the 2-to-2 scattering cross-section for a self-interacting dark matter model.

The class `ClassicalApproximation_class` in this repository is a numerical approximation to the 2-to-2 scattering cross-section in the classical (non-quantum) limit.

Our implementation allows the user to specify the dark matter model symbolically, using `SymPy`, and over a wide dynamical range.

The notebook `Example.ipynb` provides a brief example of how to use this module.
